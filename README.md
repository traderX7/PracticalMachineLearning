Coursera Course's Course Project Writeup and submission
-------------------------------------

This repository was created for the course project writeup which is composed of R Markdown file and its HTML document. 
It involves from getting dataset, cleaning and preprocessing to machine learning modeling and evaluation. Machine learning methods are classification tree, random forests and boosting to be tried. In terms of their prediction accuracy, random forest is the highest and second is boosting. Reading many comments on the course Forum, they need considerable time to train data. And some of them used only 3000 rows for the time efficiency. But in my case, I trained dataset with full 13737 rows for training set which was divided to two set, training and testing, from raw training set. Nevertheless, it took about 30 minites to process three methods and output good results.
